WeatherAssignment

1) I have tried to get weather data from openAPI's and formatted thourgh DTO Weather*DTO classes.

2) Just come up with another solution and mock the JSON data for 2 apis and put it into the application.properties file.
Reading the data using object Mapper and calculating the mean of those two temperatures.

3) Developed user API's also which is storing the user details ( city and userName) preferences.

4) Tried to implement cache using hashmap in Constants class.  if user details is already available then read it from constant Map else read it from database.

5) Hardcoding the values to match the user criteria and send the notification. ( just put System out to assume the notification sent.)
